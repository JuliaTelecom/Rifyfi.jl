RiFyFi is a framework for Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification. RFF is a unique signature created in the emitter transmission chain by the hardware impairments. These impairments may be used as a secure identifier as they cannot be easily replicated for spoofing purposes. In recent years, the RFF identification relies mainly on Deep Learning (DL), and large databases are consequently needed to improve identification in different environmental conditions. RiFyFi is introduced to propose a framework combine with a virtual database to explore the RFF identification. Different transmission scenarios are modeled such as the data type (being a preamble or a payload) and the data size. 



Create a folders
Download or clone the project with git clone 
Going in Rifyfi.jl
Open Julia terminal
Activate the project ] activate .
Instantiate the project with ] instantiate 

Then you can use RiFyFi in two manners: 
-   Creating random parameter values for impairments 
-   Define the value of the impairments parameters with scenario file
